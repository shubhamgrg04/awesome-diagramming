# Awesome Diagramming [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A curated list of awesome diagramming tools available for software engineering teams. Feel free to contribute to this on-going list.


### **When diagrams are useful?**  
Diagrams are faster and compact way for knowledge transfer. It's much easier to convey system architechture with a diagram compared to writing an essay on it.

Diagrams are especially useful in providing high level overview of software design. Following are the most-widely used diagrams by engineering teams:
- **Sequence diagram** - to visualize interaction between different components in a sequential order 
- **System architecture diagram** - to visualize system architecture
- **ER diagram** - to visualize data models
- **Gantt diagram** - used for project planning and timeline estimation  


### **Factors to consider before choosing the diagramming tool** 
- Free / Freemium / Paid
- Open source or Closed source
- Ease of use
- Diagram as code vs Hand drawn
- Visual Appearance - Modern / Minimalistic / Outdated / Hand-drawn
